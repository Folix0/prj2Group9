### Truck driver

- How are you assigned to your work?
	- Driver takes an order from a pigeon hole and then puts a completed order back.

- Are there any requirements you need to meet as a truck driver?
	- Driver has to renew his licences for transporting hazardous liquids every few years,
	  drivers have a special licence depending on the weight limits of the trucks

- How long does delivering goods usually take?
	- Depending on the order but usually the driver can manage 2 orders per day, he can drive
	  maximum of 4 hours at a time, then he has to take a short break(at least 30 min.), his boss can track the
	  length of his break, speed of the truck and location. There is no penalty for the driver 
	  if he is late.

- Do you choose the route that you will take or is it assigned to you?
	- Driver has to first pick up the goods then he gets a list of addresses where he has to 
	  unload, he picks the route himself. Usually he unloads everything.

- Do you have to take the truck to refill to a different place?
	- He usually gets a fully loaded truck but sometimes he drives an empty truck and then 
	  picks up a full trailer.

- How do you pay for your fuel?
	- He gets a special card which is used to pay for fuel.

- When do you have to clean the trailers?
	- Usually after every delivery the trailer is cleaned. If you are transporting the same liquid
	  for example gasoline you do not have to wash the trailer. If you are delivering for example
	  clean water you do not have to wash it but if you transport milk you have to wash the trailer
	  after delivery because the milk that is going to be put inside can get contaminated from
	  the milk that was previously in the trailer.

	- No, all of the trucks and trailers belong to the company.

- Do you drive the same truck every time?
	 - Yes but sometimes the truck is not available during the maintenance so he gets another truck.

- What do you think about planning in your company?

	  that provides goods, 2nd The trailer, 3rd Truck, 4th driver. If any of these is missing then you can not make a plan.
