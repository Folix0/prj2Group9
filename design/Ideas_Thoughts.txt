Thoughts of how to implement certain things:

- driver: boolean is available smart idea?
- driver: calculate Availability method to calculate on basis of local date if the driver is available -> takes a local date of now 
and compares with info deliverydate if the driver is available on that day 



Truck, Trailer
-how do we want to calcualte when the truck, trailer are available? 

- maintenance: calculate date -> need to save kilometers driven in db and calcualte on basis of standard value for when
the truck needs to be chekced (which is to be stored in the db as well) and then compare the computed date to the local date and 
display a boolean if the truck, trailer is under maintancance
